      Did you ever thought about the process occuring in your unconsciousness when you recalling your memories?<br>
      In daily lives, we often look back on our childhood. There are lots of documents such as diaries and photos which helps you to recall those memories.
      And these documents helps us to feel nostelgia by bringing the memories that almost dimmed or already forgotten.
      <br>


      <br>
      However on second thought, keeping a record of memories with writing something and taking pictures
      which we do during the whole life might be seen as something artificial action
      since the memories that passing into silence is very normal and natural phenomenon.
      And whenever we try to recall the memories, the things in your brain changes somehow when it became particular 'words'.<br>
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
      For those reasons, I became curious how we remember and recall the things that we experienced. And it brings me to have an attention to the process of recalling memories.
